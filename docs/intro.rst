**pyrodigy** is a Python wrapper around more than 70 optimizers from [pytorch_optimizer](https://github.com/kozistr/pytorch_optimizer), along with some additional custom optimizers. Designed for flexibility, pyrodigy offers easy configuration management, history tracking, and a CLI for convenience.

- **Config Management**: View, add, set, or remove optimizer configurations directly from the CLI.
- **History Tracking**: Track optimizer instantiations with detailed history, including timestamps, parameters, and caller information.
- **Customizable TTL**: Automatically clear history entries older than a specified time-to-live (TTL).
- **Rich CLI Interface**: Manage configurations, view documentation, and explore historyâ€”all from the command line.
